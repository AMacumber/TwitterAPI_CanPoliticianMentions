# ReadMe: TwitterAPI_CanPoliticianMentions

## Description
Replicating the final project for DataCamp's ["Importing Data in Python (Part 2)"](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/python-data-science-toolbox-part-2) course.

It involved sampling Twitter's API for tweets that mentioned American Political Candidates. I want to replicate this but using Canadian Political Candidates.

## Future Directions
Hosting a graph that will update periodically and/or showing a timeline of mentions.
